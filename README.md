# Data-Mining-Project-Class
# Analyzing Marketing Campaign

## Project Description
The project was to understanding how **marketing of X company** can be done **effectively** with **data mining** methods. 

## Dataset Description
The dataset was originally from https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test.

## Method
This main idea of this project is categorized into two step: 1. Feature Engineering with statistical methods 2. Clustering Data with Agglomerative Hieararchy.

## Results and Analysis
Overall from the method i've used to clustering data (Agglomerative Hieararchy), i've got an optimum clusters which are 3 clusters. 
### 1. Low Cluster
* This cluster **has** the **lowest income** among other clusters, and the **costs** incurred are also **the lowest** compared to other clusters.
* This group **has couples** who are **married** with **high relatives** and also have **relatively high children**.
* High costs fromj this cluster is gold, most often it passes through the net.
* If the company doing the product campaign, this cluster **not frequently attend the discount campaign**. But have **the number of buying discount** item with **relative high**.

### 2. High Cluster
* This cluster **has** the **highest income** among other clusters, and the **costs** incurred are also **the highest** compared to other clusters.
* This cluster has married couples with a ratio of almost half of those who are not married, but have no children at all.
* High costs from this cluster are all items, most often through the store or in person.
* If the company doing the product campaign, this cluster **most frequently attend the discount campaign**. But have **the number of buying discount item with relative low**. 

### 3. Middle Cluster
* Is a cluster with income that is in the middle between other clusters, and the costs incurred are also in the middle between the low and high clusters.
* For couples, this cluster is almost the same as the high cluster but this cluster has many children.
* High costs from this cluster is gold, mostly bought via the web.
* If the company doing the product campaign, this cluster **not frequently attend the discount campaign**. But have **the number of buying discount item with relative high**. 

As a follow results from three clusters, it can be seen that there may be a slight mistake when the company doing its marketing. It is proven by the interest that follows the campaign from a high cluster is high but to buy the product being campaigned is relatively very low. From the point that i can see, **the companies should be doing the research e.g through form etc.** especially **for** the **interest of high cluster items**. From the data that i've analyzed, **the behaviour** of high cluster is **buying all items** with high cost which is indicates this cluster **only buying the fancy things on each product**.
